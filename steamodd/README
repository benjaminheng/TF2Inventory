Steamodd is a project that grew out of a 200 line test script I
wrote to test out the new API and find stuff I could complain about.

There are still some hacky spots but overall the modules should be
usable in a project.

Be sure to set your api key and language before using any of the module functions.
It can be defined in the core config file which is currently in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/
steammod.rc.d/core.js in GNU/Linux systems and %APPDATA%/steammod/steammod.rc.d/core.js
on Windows.

You can also set it directly in your code by calling steam.set_api_key and
steam.set_language

If you don't have an API key it's easy to register for one at
