About
===
TF2Inventory consolidates the inventories of your various TF2 accounts (such as idle accounts) and formats it into a HTML table. The table is sorted into crates, tools, metal, and each of the classes. The rows are then further sorted according to item qualities.

TF2Inventory allows you to quickly view what items you have available in your accounts. Just do a CTRL-F search on the generated HTML page.

* `accounts`: A comma-separated list of your TF2 accounts.
